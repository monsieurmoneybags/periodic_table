# periodic_table
periodic_table.sh is a simple bash script to show the periodic table of elements in a terminal window.

This script uses VT100 box-drawing characters to put the elements in a grid-like display:

The COLOR variable holds the color of the grid. It is set to violet (1;35m) but you could change it to any other valid color for your terminal.
